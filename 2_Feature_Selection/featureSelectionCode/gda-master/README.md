# Generalized Discriminant Analysis
 
GDA Performs Generalized Discriminant Analysis, a non-linear feature dimensionality reduction technique.
 
GDA is one of dimensionality reduction techniques, which projects a data matrix from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space by maximizing the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter.
