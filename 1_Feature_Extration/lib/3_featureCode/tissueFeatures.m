% TISSUEFEATURES   Extract tissue features from unmixed image
%    FEAT = TISSUEFEATURES( prot, dna, DBTYPE, NLEVELS) 
%    calculates 839 morphological and wavelet texture features.
%    I is the protein image, J is the nuclear image, DBTYPE
%    is the type of filter that should be used for the wavelet
%    decomposition, and NLEVELS is the number of decomposition 
%    levels.
% 
%    Inputs values are: 
%    prot = graylevel, uint8 protein image
%    dna = graylevel, uint8 nuclear image
%    DBTYPE = 'db1',db2',..., or 'db10'
%    NLEVELS = 1,2..., whatever is allowed by image dimensions.
%         A value of 10 is typically used
